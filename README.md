# Sonar-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Collected a small dataset from kaggle that contains 208 sonar data with a binary output (Where the data represents either Rock or Mine). 
This is a supervised learning & output is binary that's why i applied logistic Regression algorithm here.
Used Libraries to make the model:
1) Numpy 
2) Pandas
3) Logistic Regression from Sk-learn
4) Accuracy Score from Sk-learn

Accuracy of testing data is: 0.76 (dataset was too small)
